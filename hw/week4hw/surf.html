                    <div class="col-lg-12 ">
                        <p1 class="lead">For hundreds of years, surfing was a central part of ancient Polynesian
                            culture.
                            Surfing may have first been observed by British explorers at Tahiti in 1767. Samuel Wallis
                            and the
                            crew members of HMS Dolphin were the first Britons to visit the island in June of that year.
                            Another
                            candidate is the botanist Joseph Banks[2] being part of the first voyage of James Cook on
                            HMS
                            Endeavour, who arrived on Tahiti on 10 April 1769. Lieutenant James King was the first
                            person to
                            write about the art of surfing on Hawaii when he was completing the journals of Captain
                            James Cook
                            upon Cook's death in 1779.

                            Swell is generated when the wind blows consistently over a large area of open water, called
                            the
                            wind's fetch. The size of a swell is determined by the strength of the wind and the length
                            of its
                            fetch and duration. Because of this, surf tends to be larger and more prevalent on
                            coastlines
                            exposed to large expanses of ocean traversed by intense low pressure systems.

                            The most important influence on wave shape is the topography of the seabed directly behind
                            and
                            immediately beneath the breaking wave. The contours of the reef or bar front become
                            stretched by
                            diffraction. Each break is different since each location's underwater topography is unique.
                            At beach
                            breaks, sandbanks change shape from week to week. Surf forecasting is aided by advances in
                            information technology. Mathematical modeling graphically depicts the size and direction of
                            swells
                            around the globe.

                            Surfers represent a diverse culture based on riding the waves. Some people practice surfing
                            as a
                            recreational activity while others make it the central focus of their lives. Surfing culture
                            is most
                            dominant in Hawaii and California because these two states offer the best surfing
                            conditions.
                            However, waves can be found wherever there is coastline, and a tight-knit yet far-reaching
                            subculture of surfers has emerged throughout America. Some historical markers of the culture
                            included the woodie, the station wagon used to carry surfers' boards, as well as
                            boardshorts, the
                            long swim shorts typically worn while surfing. Surfers also wear wetsuits in colder regions.

                            Surfing can be done on various equipment, including surfboards, longboards, stand up paddle
                            boards
                            (SUPs), bodyboards, wave skis, skimboards, kneeboards, surf mats and macca's trays.
                            Surfboards were
                            originally made of solid wood and were large and heavy (often up to 370 cm (12 ft) long and
                            having a
                            mass of 70 kg (150 lb)). Lighter balsa wood surfboards (first made in the late 1940s and
                            early
                            1950s) were a significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing
                            maneuverability.
